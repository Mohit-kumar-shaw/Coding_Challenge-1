## What was the Challenge?

### The Rules Are:

1. You have until Feb 9th at midnight EST to submit your website (using Github pages to put it online. If you don't know how to do that, check out Lecture 66 in the course). You will have to submit the link to the #coding_challenge slack group with the following message:  "Coding Challenge#1 Submission:<your link here> check it out @Andrei Neagoie". Submissions not following the above rules will not be judged. 

2. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, slack, etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own!

3. The top 3 winners will be picked by myself and some of the team members of Creative Tim at our own discretion and announced a few days after Feb 9th when the contest ends. The three students will receive the Big Bundle for free from Creative Tim. 

### The Challenge:

Using the free Material Kit (http://demos.creative-tim.com/material-kit/index.html) you will have to build something like this: https://blockchaindemo.io.

Looks difficult? Don't worry, being a developer is all about making small steps towards the end goal. Along the way, you will learn about the Blockchain Data Structure and have another project to put into your portfolio. 

To start you off, I recommend you check out these 2 resources to get the basics of what a blockchain is:
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8
2. http://www.darrenbeck.co.uk/blockchain/nodejs/nodejscrypto/

The rest is up to you to research and figure out. Use this as a challenge to learn about blockchain (which will be very important in the future) and also build a portfolio website. I wouldn't be wasting your time if I didn't think this is a great project that would wow your future employers. 

Can't wait to see the submissions! Thank you for being part of this course and the community!
